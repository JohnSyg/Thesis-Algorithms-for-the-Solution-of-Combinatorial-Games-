# Thesis-Algorithms for the Solution of Combinatorial Games

The topic on which this thesis focuses is combinatorial games, a subclass of
combinatorial optimization problems. Determining the ideal move based on the information
available to the player at any given moment is the main problem this research field is
dealing with. Based on this, the problems studied are, an unbeatable implementation
of a Min-Max agent for Tic-Tac-Toe, the comparison between the algorithms MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning in the game Connect-4, the determination of the most
ideal algorithm among Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A* (
with Manhattan Distance as Heuristic), A* (with Manhattan Distance as Heuristic but
also Reversal Penalty), Branch-And-Bound Search (B&B) and Iterative-Deepening
Search (IDS) for solving the 8-Puzzle and similarly the determination of the most
ideal algorithm among the aforementioned for finding the shortest path of the knight
pawn on a chessboard with N Ã— N dimensions.
